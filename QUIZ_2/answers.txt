1. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping and it lets you manipulate data from a database using object-oriented programming. You will be able to interact directly with an object which is easier to handle than for example T-SQL
2. Server Side Rendering the server will convert HTML files that will be usable in the browser, for example, your visiting a page then you will request to the server and then the server will send you back a fully rendered HTML and displays it on your screen and this will occur also when you will visit another page.
3. OAuth is for authorization, this will help the user be authenticated safely without sharing their password, this also uses tokens to prove the user's identity.
4. Server Side Rendering is a good idea if you are going to change frequently the page like for example
(
facebook - they need dynamically change the pages depending on for example the posts of your friends, 
Instagram - same as Facebook, they need to change it dynamically, 
twitter - same 
) This website uses server-side rendering heavily because they need it to be dynamic
5. Static Rendering is a good idea if you will not change its content for a long time for example 
(
about page - this page will not be updated anytime soon, 
contact page - this page will not be updated unless you change your contact information, 
or blog - this page will unlikely to be updated because this is already done in the past maybe it will be change if you forgot to add something that you forgot
) these pages/websites need not be updated often.
